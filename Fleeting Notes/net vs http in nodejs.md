difference between http and net in nodejs

In Node.js, the `http` module is used to create an HTTP server, while the `net` module is used to create a server for a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection. The `http` module provides several methods for creating an HTTP server, including the `createServer()` method, which is used to create an HTTP server that listens for client requests and sends responses. The `net` module, on the other hand, provides a way to create a server that listens for connections from a client over a TCP connection. This can be useful for creating a server that handles more low-level network communication, such as custom protocols.

Here's an example of how to use the `http` module to create an HTTP server:

```
const http = require('http');  

// Create an HTTP server 
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {

// Handle incoming requests   
res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});   
res.end('Hello World\n'); 

});  

// Listen for connections on port 8000 
server.listen(8000);
```


And here's an example of how to use the `net` module to create a TCP server:

```
const net = require('net');  

// Create a TCP server 
const server = net.createServer((socket) => {   

// Handle incoming connections   
socket.write('Hello World\n');   
socket.end(); 

});  

// Listen for connections on port 8000 
server.listen(8000);
```

In summary, the `http` module is used for creating HTTP servers in Node.js, while the `net` module is used for creating TCP servers. Both modules provide different features and capabilities, and which one to use depends on the specific needs of your application.
