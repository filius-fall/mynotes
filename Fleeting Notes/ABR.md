My Summary:

ABR stands for Adaptive Bitrate, it's a video streaming protocol.
It is created to make best user experience for watching video content

ABR divides the signal into chuncks and stores different quality of each chunck so that based on the users internet speed the quality will be adjusted to give user seamless experience

So thats why for youtube livestream you can go back in timestamps bcs of ABR since the each chunck is stored in server if we move to a particular time stamp the youtube can start to serve from that part of the video.

whereas twitch uses RTMP(real time Messaging protocol) which is used for its low latency streams. Since it doesnt establish a http connection with server it just sends the data in linear fashion that is why we cant move back in timestamp for twitch streams


ChatGPT summary:

**What is ABR protocol**

ABR stands for Adaptive Bitrate, it's a video streaming protocol. The main goal of ABR is to provide the best viewing experience to the end-user by adapting the quality of the video being streamed to the available network conditions in real-time. The idea is to constantly monitor the network conditions and adjust the video quality accordingly. For example, if the network is congested, the ABR algorithm will switch to a lower bitrate version of the video to ensure smooth playback, and when the network improves, the algorithm switches back to a higher quality version of the video. This way, the end-user can have a seamless viewing experience, even in fluctuating network conditions. ABR is widely used for delivering video content over the internet, and most modern video players and streaming platforms support ABR.


**Is this way of serving live stream content economical for server hosting company**

Serving live stream content using the Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) protocol can be more economical for a server hosting company, compared to serving a single high-quality video stream. ABR allows the server to serve multiple versions of the same video stream, each at a different bitrate, making it possible to adjust the quality to the end-user's network conditions in real-time. This means that the server can serve a lower quality version of the video to a user with a slow internet connection, reducing the amount of bandwidth required, and conversely, serve a higher quality version to a user with a fast connection.

By serving multiple versions of the same video stream, ABR can reduce the overall strain on the server, allowing it to serve more users simultaneously, while still delivering a good quality video experience to each individual user. Additionally, because ABR is designed to adapt to changing network conditions, it can also help to reduce buffering and interruptions, providing a more stable viewing experience, which in turn can help to reduce user churn.

Overall, the benefits of ABR for the server hosting company are improved efficiency and scalability, which can result in cost savings, especially when serving a large number of users simultaneously. However, it is worth noting that serving multiple versions of the same video stream also requires additional storage and computing resources, so there is a trade-off that needs to be considered.

**does youtube use ABR**

Yes, YouTube uses the Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) protocol for its video streaming services. ABR allows YouTube to dynamically adjust the quality of the video being streamed to match the end-user's network conditions in real-time. This means that if a user has a slow internet connection, YouTube can serve a lower quality version of the video, reducing the amount of bandwidth required, while still providing a smooth playback experience. When the user's network conditions improve, YouTube can switch to a higher quality version of the video, providing a better viewing experience.

Using ABR is essential for delivering high-quality video content over the internet, as it ensures that users with different network conditions can receive the best possible experience. By using ABR, YouTube can ensure that users receive a stable, interruption-free viewing experience, regardless of fluctuations in network conditions. This helps to provide a better user experience and reduce user churn, which is beneficial for both YouTube and its users.


**So that means youtube stores different quality video on serves the user based on their internet speed**

Yes, that's correct. YouTube stores multiple versions of each video, each at a different bitrate, and serves the version that best matches the end-user's network conditions. When a user requests a video, YouTube's servers evaluate the user's network conditions and determine the best version of the video to serve. If the user's network conditions are poor, YouTube will serve a lower quality version of the video to ensure smooth playback, and if the user's network conditions improve, YouTube can switch to a higher quality version of the video.

By serving multiple versions of the same video, YouTube can ensure that the video can be watched by users with different network conditions, providing a good quality experience for all users, regardless of the speed of their internet connection. This approach is made possible by the Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) protocol, which allows the video quality to be adjusted in real-time based on the user's network conditions.


**then how does rtmp differ from abr**

RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) and Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) are both technologies used for video streaming, but they serve different purposes.

RTMP is a protocol for transmitting audio, video, and data between a server and a client over the internet. RTMP is often used for live streaming, as it provides a low-latency, high-throughput connection, which is essential for real-time broadcasting. RTMP is also commonly used as a transport protocol, as it allows the video data to be efficiently sent from the encoder to the streaming server.

Adaptive Bitrate (ABR), on the other hand, is a technique used to improve the viewing experience of video content over the internet. ABR allows the video quality to be adjusted in real-time based on the user's network conditions, ensuring that the video can be watched smoothly even in fluctuating network conditions. With ABR, the video is encoded into multiple versions, each at a different bitrate, and the video player selects the best version to play based on the user's network conditions.

So, in summary, RTMP is a protocol used for transmitting video data, while ABR is a technique used to optimize the video viewing experience for users with different network conditions. RTMP and ABR can be used together, as RTMP can be used as the transport protocol for delivering ABR video streams.


**why does RTMP provide low latency but not abr**

RTMP provides low latency because it is designed to prioritize speed and efficiency over other factors such as reliability. RTMP uses a persistent connection between the server and the client, which allows for real-time communication and minimizes the amount of time it takes for data to travel from the server to the client. This results in low latency, which is essential for real-time streaming applications, such as live broadcasting.

Adaptive Bitrate (ABR), on the other hand, does not inherently provide low latency. ABR's main focus is to dynamically adjust the quality of the video being streamed to match the end-user's network conditions in real-time. This is achieved by encoding the video into multiple versions, each at a different bitrate, and serving the best version based on the user's network conditions. While ABR can help to improve the overall quality of the video experience, it does not necessarily reduce latency.

That being said, it is possible to use ABR with low latency streaming, for example, by using a low latency video codec and reducing the number of times the video quality changes during playback. However, the trade-off is that low latency ABR streams may have a lower video quality compared to traditional ABR streams.

In conclusion, RTMP provides low latency because it is designed specifically for real-time streaming, while ABR is focused on optimizing the video quality for users with different network conditions. While ABR can be used in low latency streaming, it is not a guarantee, and the level of latency will depend on the specific implementation.
