# Importance of navigation internet correctly
Creation Date: 2022-09-18T22:43


Unlike the popular opinin that internet will help us provide everything we want i feel as if it does the opposite instead providing what we want if we are not careful it may drown us in the infromation 

Its just like the case if we drown a person in ocean just because he is thirsty, his thirst may not go away but he will be chocked to death due to excess water.
- So we should be careful navigating the internet(either youtube/twitter/instagram/google)
- For tutorials prioritize offical documentation and select handful of youtube vidoes without searching indefentiely
- The observation I did was I was getting a great dopamine hit for searching about the thing I want to learn instead of actually learning the thing
- So Controlling the dopmaine levels consiciouslly is also important
